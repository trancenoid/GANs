# GANs
Repository for my Generative Adversarial Models related projects and some resources.

My Projects:
Doggo-GAN : GAN trained on 20000+ dogs images.

Smiley-GAN : GAN trained on 3000~ manually web-scrapped emojis.

AudioGAN : A project to explore GAN's effectivity on Audio data, Since most of audio generation method focus on Sampling, I tried to try out it myself.

GAN_MNIST: Learning project to get familiar with DCGAN.


Resources:
DCGAN MNIST : A standard DCGAN approach for MNIST dataset.
